# OS212 - Vincent Suryakim
## [Home](https://vincentsuryakim.github.io/os212/) | [Logs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vincentsuryakim/os212/master/TXT/mylog.txt) | [Links](https://vincentsuryakim.github.io/os212/LINKS) | [Repository](https://github.com/vincentsuryakim/os212)

1. [Main OS Link](https://os.vlsm.org)<br>
This link is the main source of information for the Operating Systems course. It contains many essential items such as our weekly powerpoint slides.

2. [Debuggex (Regular Expressions)](https://www.debuggex.com)<br>
I believe that regular expressions or regex is very important for us to learn and the best way to learn regex is by doing. Therefore, I think that this website is a great way for us to learn regex because it also provides a visualizer for the regular expressions.

3. [Grep Command](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/)<br>
I think that the grep command is very useful to search for a keyword within a file. I found that this article is very useful and easy for understand for us to learn the Grep command.

4. [Sed Command](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sed-command-in-linux-unix-with-examples/z)<br>
I think that the sed command is another useful command to learn because of its capabilities to find and replace keywords within a file easily. I think that this article is especially useful to learn the command.

5. [C Programming Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJgsSFOSQv0)<br>
I think that C is an important language especially for Operating Systems, and I would love to learn the language even more. Therefore, I think that this video is very useful for us to learn the language even more.

6. [C Language Cheatsheet](https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/c-cheatsheet)<br>
Another way to learn the C language is by doing. When learning the language, I often encounter many bugs. Therefore, I think that this cheatsheet is very useful for us to debug and learn the language even more.

7. [Big Endian and Little Endian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1C9Kj_78ek)<br>
Everytime I read this week's slides, I often read about Big Endian and Little Endian. Therefore, I think that we all need to learn more about Big Endian and Little Endian. I think that this link can help us to understand more about them.

8. [Addressing in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzMCuw_5dfM)<br>
Other than Big Endian and Little Endian, I often encounter topics about addressing in C. Therefore, I think that it is vital to understand further about addressing.

9. [Introduction to Pointers in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2i0CnUOniA)<br>
I also learn about pointers in C this week, and I think that we need to learn more about pointers in C as I believe that it will help us in the future. I believe that this link is a powerful gateway to learn even further about pointers in C.

10. [Virtual Memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)
I think that the knowledge about virtual memories are very important. All of us need to learn more about virtual memories in order to further cement our knowledge about computer science. This link has been useful for me and I hope that this link will also be useful for you.

11. [Memory Allocation Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10vroQb5IdY)
Not just virtual memories, I also think that memory allocation algorithms are very important for us to understand in order to create a memory efficient algorithm in the future. I think that this link is very important because it has been a great source of knowledge for me, and I want to share it with all of you.
