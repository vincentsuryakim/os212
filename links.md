## [Home](https://vincentsuryakim.github.io/os212/) | [Logs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vincentsuryakim/os212/master/TXT/mylog.txt) | [Links](https://vincentsuryakim.github.io/os212/LINKS) |[Repository](https://github.com/vincentsuryakim/os212)

1. [Main OS Link](https://os.vlsm.org)<br>
This link is the main source of information for the Operating Systems course. It contains many essential items such as our weekly powerpoint slides.

2. [Debuggex (Regular Expressions)](https://www.debuggex.com)<br>
I believe that regular expressions or regex is very important for us to learn and the best way to learn regex is by doing. Therefore, I think that this website is a great way for us to learn regex because it also provides a visualizer for the regular expressions.

3. [Grep Command](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/)<br>
I think that the grep command is very useful to search for a keyword within a file. I found that this article is very useful and easy for understand for us to learn the Grep command.

4. [Sed Command](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sed-command-in-linux-unix-with-examples/z)<br>
I think that the sed command is another useful command to learn because of its capabilities to find and replace keywords within a file easily. I think that this article is especially useful to learn the command.
